# Project Overview

## Purpose
Times of Twitter extracts relevant tweets from your feed, summarizes them using AI, and formats them into a newspaper-style PDF delivered via email.

## Workflow
1. **Extract tweets**: Fetches the latest tweets from your timeline using the Twitter API.
2. **Summarization**: Uses AI to create concise summaries of tweets.
3. **PDF Formatting**: Summarized content is formatted into a clean, readable newspaper.
4. **Email Delivery**: The final newspaper is emailed to the user every morning.

## Current Limitations
- Only handles text-based tweets.
- No support for multimedia (videos, GIFs).
- Summarization is not yet personalized.
